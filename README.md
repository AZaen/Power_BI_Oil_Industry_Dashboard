# Power_BI_Oil_Industry_Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard exploring global oil value flows across countries, flows, and products from 2021–2023.

This Power BI project explores global oil-related monetary flows using public OECD data. It visualizes country-level oil value distribution across different flow types: net deliveries, industrial production, consumption, and storage.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- KPI Cards: Total oil value, YoY change %
- 100% Stacked Bar Chart: Flow composition by country
- Stacked Bar Chart: Top Countries By Value
- Treemap: Breakdown by flow
- Dynamic slicers: Year, flow, product

## 📈 Key Insights
- The -0.01% year-over-year change in global oil revenue represents remarkable stability given the period covers major geopolitical events, post-pandemic recovery, and economic uncertainties. This near-zero growth story is actually quite significant - it suggests the oil market found equilibrium despite external pressures.
- Canada shows significant industrial production but relatively lower consumption patterns which frames it as a key supplier in the global energy supply chain.
- Japan and South Korea present a contrast as they're heavily weighted toward consumption patterns rather than production, this is very telling about energy security in these countries.
